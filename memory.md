# WGJ Memory

This file stores durable repo-specific lessons and recurring corrections.

It is not:

- a task log
- a changelog
- a scratchpad
- a dump of one-off mistakes

## When To Add An Entry

Add an entry only when at least one of these is true:

- the user corrected a preference, constraint, or workflow that will likely matter again
- the same class of bug or fix repeated across tasks or repeated twice in one task
- a repo-specific gotcha caused rework, a bad assumption, or wasted time
- a verification gap repeated enough that it should become a standing check

If the lesson is really a standing policy for all work, update `AGENTS.md` too.

## When Not To Add An Entry

Do not add entries for:

- temporary failures
- branch-specific implementation notes
- generic Swift or iOS advice
- information already captured well enough in `AGENTS.md`
- one-off debugging details that are unlikely to recur

## Entry Format

Use this exact shape for each durable lesson:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD - Short Title

- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Trigger/Problem:
- Root Cause:
- Durable Rule:
- How to Verify Next Time:
- Status: active
```

Use `Status: superseded` when an entry is no longer the active rule, and explain the replacement in the entry body.

## Active Lessons

No durable lessons recorded yet.

Promote a lesson here only when it clears the bar above.
